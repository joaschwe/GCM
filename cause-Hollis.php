                        Our mission is to open the world to adults with developmental disabilities in central Indiana.
                        Hollis Adams (HA) is a privately funded nonprofit that has served adults with developmental
                        disabilities for 50 years. We offer social, recreational, and community-based opportunities
                        through a wide variety of events and activities.</p>

                    <h4 class="sec2-title">The Legacy of Hollis Adams</h4>
                    <p class="sec2-content">
                        In 1969, parents of individuals with developmental disabilities founded Hollis Adams (HA) to
                        meet the evolving needs of children aging out of the educational system. Originally called
                        Activities of Daily Living (ADL), the primary focus of Hollis Adams was learning and practicing
                        basic skills with an emphasis on increasing independence. Participants learned to cook, clean,
                        and follow a schedule in a sheltered environment surrounded by peers and parents. As a result of
                        the close-knit group of parents and children, many lasting relationships were formed and the
                        vision of Hollis Adamsâ€™ founders began to expand.</p>
                    <p>In 1985, the Foundation was named a beneficiary of the estate of Rose Marie Ellis. The gift was
                        in honor of her friend, Margaret Healey, who was active with the Foundation. With this wonderful
                        and unexpected gift, the Board renewed their commitment to serve adults with developmental
                        disabilities, but chose to focus their efforts on quality social and recreational activities.
                        Initially, most of the social activities involved one-time outings to special events such as
                        concerts, plays, and short driving trips to nearby towns and landmarks. The Board ultimately
                        decided to offer ongoing programs, starting with square dancing lessons and water aerobics.
                        Thanks to the dedication and creativity of our staff, HA programs realized incredible growth.
                        Now we have expanded beyond evening activities to include HAFriends: four days of engaging
                        outings, skill building activities, volunteerism opportunities, and social recreation each week.
                        HA is proud to be a family environment, focused on providing a place for our friends to
                        establish and grow lasting, meaningful relationships and contribute to our local community. Each
                        day of HAFriends includes both pre-planned events and impromptu activities and trips chosen by
                        our participants. HAFriends now functions as a safe, loving platform for interacting with
                        friends, improving social and practical skills, and developing healthy routines. Currently,
                        Hollis Adams evening activities and HAFriends are making a positive impact in the lives of over
                        250 participants, and our numbers are increasing each month.
